# StudyNotion EdTech Project

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack web application, designed to replicate the functionality of popular online learning platforms like Udemy. Users can register as either instructors or students. Instructors have the ability to create and upload courses, while students can browse, purchase, and enroll in courses.
